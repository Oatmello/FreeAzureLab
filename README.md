## First Things First
Hi! Welcome to my Microsoft Azure tutortial! Microsoft offers a free Azure trial that comes with access to popular Azure products for 12 months, $200 credir for your first 30 days, and access to 25 products that will always be free. Let's dive right into it!

Note that the signup process requires one to provide user's phone number and credit card information. However, we got the $200 credit for the next 30 days. Then it is a pay-as-you-go model. 

Now that your done signing up, let's log into the azure portal.
